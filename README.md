# bbh-server
Server for Boxhead Bounty Hunter

NOTES: This server is currently local only and runs on Python. To run the server locally, you need to:

1. Clone/Download the files
2. Move the "assets.swf" and "Constants.xml" files to a folder called "_assets" that is in the same directory that you downloaded the rest of the data (e.g. server.py)
3. Install Python and dependencies if not already installed
4. In a terminal/PowerShell window, navigate to the directory containing the files and run "python server.py"
5. open the .swf file using Adobe Flash Player Projector.
6. Connect and enter a username and password on the login screen (NOT create account!). It will log you in and create the account you asked for. If you forget your password just delete the Users.db file and start again
7. Enjoy! Currently you can get in lobby and ingame, but multiple users cannot see each other in the same game.
